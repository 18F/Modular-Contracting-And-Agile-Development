## How we work

SBST works with Federal agencies to achieve goals set by policy makers and provides specific recommendations for how behavioral insights can be used to reach those goals more effectively and efficiently. SBST also builds capacity in agencies to both implement and rigorously test the impact of behavioral insights directly within Federal programs.

SBST focuses on four features of program design where prior research and practice indicate that behavioral insights have a strong role to play: access to programs, the presentation of information, how policies and programs offer choices, and the structure of incentives.

1.  SBST looks for opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, and businesses access programs and benefits by streamlining processes that may otherwise limit participation.  

2.  SBST works to improve how the government presents information to consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries, by giving greater consideration to ways in which its format, timing, and medium can affect understanding.  

3.  Where programs and policies offer choices, SBST works to more carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including default settings and the number and arrangement of options, can most effectively empower participants to make the best choices for themselves and their families.

4.  Where policies create incentives to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement, SBST considers how the frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, tax credits, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, with a specific focus on opportunities to utilize non-financial incentives.
