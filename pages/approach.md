## How we work

SBST works to identify how behavioral insights can be integrated into Federal agency programs in order to help agencies achieve their missions and objectives. 

SBST focuses on four features of program design where prior research and practice indicate that behavioral insights have an especially strong role to play in program outcomes:

* SBST looks for opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, and businesses access programs and benefits by streamlining processes that may otherwise limit participation.

* SBST works to improve how the government presents information to consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries, by giving greater consideration to ways in which its format, timing, and medium can affect understanding.

* Where programs and policies offer choices, SBST works to more carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including default settings and the number and arrangement of options, can most effectively empower participants to make the best choices for themselves and their families.

* Where policies create incentives to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement, SBST considers how the frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, tax credits, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, with a specific focus on opportunities to utilize nonfinancial incentives.

## Where we work

Applying behavioral insights in the right context can lead to substantial improvements in program outcomes. Given the vast array of policies and programs across the Federal Government, and the full range of their objectives, how does SBST identify where to apply behavioral insights?

The most promising opportunities have three features:

**Policy Goal:**a well-defined policy goal — for example, income-driven repayment plans aim to empower student loan borrowers with more manageable monthy payments. Successful projects require clear goals in part because SBST itself does not set policy.

**Individual Behavior:**a link between a policy goal or program outcome and the decisions or actions of individuals - for example. This link is the essence of an SBST project. Where Federal policy outcomes do not depend on behavior, applications of behavioral insights will have little relevance, no matter how worthwhile the goal.

**Program Touchpoint:** a point of direct interaction between the Federal government and individuals. This point could be an application process or form, a website that offers program choices, information about government resources that are available to the public, or the structure of incentives (both financial and nonfinancial). SBST explores how behavioral insights can inform that interaction in ways that can potentially improve outcomes. If the goal is to help borrowers manage their student debt, for example, the application process for alternative repayment plans represents a touchpoint where behavioral insights could help borrowers choose the option that’s right for them.
