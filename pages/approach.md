## What are the social and behavioral sciences?

We don’t always make decisions that line up with our goals. For example, we might work out every day in January, but stop in February or March. We might not realize that we were getting increased promotional emails from a default setting. We might want to start saving...next month.

Humans are assumed to be logical, rational, carefully weigh costs agains benefits, have excellent self-control in pursuit of long-term goals, and be unaffected by our environment and emotions.

Likely unsurprising to you - we don't always act like this! We're often impulsive, influenced by others around us, and generally face limited time, countless distractions, and have lots of things to do. Reading pages of small-text mortgage disclosures doesn't often rank high on the priority list. Nor does re-answering questions on long government forms.

Many government programs and services - designed with the best of intentions - don't account for how human beings work.

Fortunately, there have been many advancements in understanding the way we process information, make decisions and take action. Researchers in the soclal and behavioral sciences - cross cutting economics, psychology, management, and other fields - study how we understand information, evaluate choices, access benefits, plan for the future, and more. We then apply this research to federal government programs so that we can build better tools and services for citizens.

## How we work

SBST works with Federal agencies to achieve goals set by policy makers and provides specific recommendations for how behavioral insights can be used to reach those goals more effectively and efficiently. SBST also builds capacity in agencies to both implement and rigorously test the impact of behavioral insights directly within Federal programs.

SBST focuses on four features of program design where prior research and practice indicate that behavioral insights have a strong role to play: access to programs, the presentation of information, how policies and programs offer choices, and the structure of incentives.

1.  SBST looks for opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, and businesses access programs and benefits by streamlining processes that may otherwise limit participation.  
2.  SBST works to improve how the government presents information to consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries, by giving greater consideration to ways in which its format, timing, and medium can affect understanding.  
3.  Where programs and policies offer choices, SBST works to more carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including default settings and the number and arrangement of options, can most effectively empower participants to make the best choices for themselves and their families.
4.  Where policies create incentives to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement, SBST considers how the frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, tax credits, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, with a specific focus on opportunities to utilize non-financial incentives.

## Where we Work

Given the vast span of policies and programs across the Federal government, and the full range of their objectives, how does SBST identify where to apply behavioral insights?

SBST has found that three key elements define the most promising behavioral insights projects:

* An established policy goal: SBST projects support well-defined policy or social goals that address an important challenge and seek to achieve an outcome that is defined and measurable. For example, improving program integrity in Medicare to save taxpayer dollars, or improving access to credit programs to promote economic sustainability among borrowers. Successful projects require clear goals in part because SBST itself does not articulate policy goals. Behavioral insights represent a means to improving outcomes, but are not an end in themselves.
* An area in which the Federal government directly interacts with individuals: This could be an application process and form, a website that offers program choices, information about government resources that are available to the public, or the structure of incentives (both financial and, especially, non-financial).
Identifying a clear touchpoint is essential for SBST projects because it represents the point at which the Federal government directly engages with Americans. SBST can then explore how behavioral insights could inform that interaction in ways that can potentially improve outcomes. If the goal is to help borrowers manage their student debt, for example, the application process for alternative repayment plans represents a point where behavioral insights could be applied to help borrowers choose the option that’s right for them.
* A program outcome that is dependent upon the decisions or actions of individuals: This is the essence of an SBST project—the way in which policy goals relate to how people engage with or respond to those policies and programs. Without this link, where Federal policy objectives do not depend closely on individual behavior, applications of behavioral insights will have little relevance, no matter how worthwhile the goal."
