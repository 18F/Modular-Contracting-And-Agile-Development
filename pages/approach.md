SBST translates findings and methods from the social and behavioral sciences into improvements in Federal policies and programs. 

We focus on four aspects of program design where prior research and practice indicate that behavioral insights have an especially strong role to play in program outcomes:

* opportunities to streamline access to programs and benefits for qualifying individuals, families, and businesses.
* 
* opportunities to improve how Government presents information to consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries.
* 
* opportunities to enhance how Government presents and structure choices within programs, including default settings and the number and arrangement of options.
* 
* opportunities to examine the frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, tax credits, and other incentives (financial and non-financial).

## Where we work

Applying behavioral insights in the right context can lead to substantial improvements in program outcomes. How does SBST identify where to apply behavioral insights?

The most promising opportunities have three features:

**Policy Goal:** a well-defined policy goal, defining the outcomes of interest. Successful projects require clear policy goals in part because SBST itself does not set policy.

**Individual Behavior:** a link between a policy goal and the decisions or actions of individuals. This link is the essence of an SBST project. Where Federal policy outcomes do not depend on behavior, applications of behavioral insights will have little relevance, no matter how worthwhile the goal.

**Program Touchpoint:** a point of direct interaction between the Federal government and individuals. This point could be an application process or form, a website that offers program choices, the structure of incentives (financial and nonfinancial), etc.

So for example, if the policy goal is to help borrowers manage their student debt, the individual behavior might be whether or not to apply for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, and the program touchpoint might be the IDR application. And behavioral insights might suggest ways to most clearly present the IDR options and make the application as simple and intuitive as possible.
