## How we work

SBST seeks to build capacity in government by directly partnering experts with agency counterparts to identify opportunities, design, and rigorously test the impact of behaviorally-informed program improvements.

SBST focuses on four features of program design where prior research and practice indicate that behavioral insights have an especially strong role to play in program outcomes:

* SBST looks for opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, and businesses access programs and benefits by streamlining processes that may otherwise limit participation.

* SBST works to improve how the government presents information to consumers, borrowers, and program beneficiaries, by giving greater consideration to ways in which its format, timing, and medium can affect understanding.

* Where programs and policies offer choices, SBST works to more carefully consider how the presentation and structure of those choices, including default settings and the number and arrangement of options, can most effectively empower participants to make the best choices for themselves and their families.

* Where policies create incentives to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement, SBST considers how the frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, tax credits, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, with a specific focus on opportunities to utilize nonfinancial incentives.

## Where we work

Applying behavioral insights in the right context can lead to substantial improvements in program outcomes. Given the vast array of policies and programs across the Federal Government, and the full range of their objectives, how does SBST identify where to apply behavioral insights?

SBST has found that three key elements define the most promising opportunities to apply behavioral insights:

**Policy Goals:** SBST projects support well-defined policy goals or already-identified program challenges—for example, improving program integrity in Medicare to save taxpayer dollars. Successful projects require clear goals in part because SBST itself does not set policy.

**Individual Behavior:** SBST projects identify a link between a policy goal or program outcome and the decisions or actions of individuals. This link is the essence of an SBST project. Where Federal policy outcomes do not depend on behavior, applications of behavioral insights will have little relevance, no matter how worthwhile the goal.

**Program Touchpoints:** SBST projects operate at a point of direct interaction between the Federal Government and individuals. This point could be an application process or form, a website that offers program choices, information about government resources that are available to the public, or the structure of incentives (both financial and nonfinancial). SBST explores how behavioral insights can inform that interaction in ways that can potentially improve outcomes. If the goal is to help borrowers manage their student debt, for example, the application process for alternative repayment plans represents a touchpoint where behavioral insights could help borrowers choose the option that’s right for them.
