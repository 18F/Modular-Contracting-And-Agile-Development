banner-text: 'Modular contracting reduces vendor lock-in, the risk of failure, and the consequences of failure, while enabling continuous competition and allowing your end users to benefit from new software in weeks — not years. It does this by breaking up a massive software project into smaller pieces and issuing multiple smaller, faster, lower-risk solicitations.'

# Modular Contracting And Agile Development

## What is this page?

This documentation will help you understand what modular contracting is, how to implement modular contracting in your organization, and how modular contracting can enable agile development. These are all real documents, not simulations. There are presentations and white papers, but a majority of these are real RFPs, quality assurance surveillance plans, questions and answers, vendor prototype challenge solicitations, evaluation factors, statements of work, and more.

Some are documents that 18F generated and used, some are documents 18F created in collaboration with partners. We hope that as more agencies use modular contracts, agile vendor pools, and develop software using agile, they will submit (via pull request, please!) documents that they are generating for inclusion in this guide.

While 18F generally approves of the contents of the documents found in this guide, none of these documents are perfect. There are lessons each of these organizations learned after executing on these documents. Different approaches are more, or less, appropriate for different situations. And there are some internal documents we are not able to share publicly. But we hope that providing you with many real world examples, you can use these as templates and modify as needed.

These documents won’t make you an expert, but if you’re interested in avoiding the waterfall/monolithic approach, this is a good guide to get you started.

## Product Strategy

* [United States Digital Service: Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/). Too many of our digital services projects do not work well, are delivered late, or are over budget. To increase the success rate of these projects, the U.S. Government needs a new approach. The United States Digital Service created a playbook of 13 key “plays” drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help government build effective digital services.

* [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/). This is a list of 12 different “factors” that an organization should employ when building a software as a service application. Employing these 12 factors will help minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project, offer maximum portability between environments, be deployable on modern cloud platforms, enable continuous deployment for maximum agility, and can scale up without significant changes. 

## Presentations

* [Presentation Modular Contracting](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Presentation%20Modular%20Contracting.pdf). An 18F presentation that explains and makes the case for modular contracting, and explains the procurement and development process under a modular contracting model.

* [Presentation Qualified Vendor Pool](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Presentation%20Qualified%20Vendor%20Pool.pdf). An 18F presentation that explains the high level rationale and process for creating and using Qualified Vendor Pools.

* [GSA's Guide to Modular Contracting](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Modular%20Contracting%20Guide.pdf). A white paper by GSA's Office of Government Wide Policy  to assist federal agencies in employing modular contracting techniques for their major information technology development efforts. It provides useful information on the application of modular contracting techniques, and it should be used in conjunction with Federal and agency regulations and directives.

* [Presentation Strangler Pattern](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Presentation%20Strangler%20Pattern.pdf). An 18F presentation explaining a software development technique called the Strangler (or Encapsulation) Pattern, an approach for migrating off legacy systems that avoids years-off "big bang" deployments and drastically decreases the time to end users using the new system.

* [Legacy Application Strangulation Case Studies](http://paulhammant.com/2013/07/14/legacy-application-strangulation-case-studies/). A series of case studies about applications of the strangler pattern.

* [Presentation Agile and Scrum for New Teams](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Presentation%20Agile%20and%20Scrum%20for%20New%20Teams.pdf). A presentation that accompanies a day-long 18F "Introduction to Agile and Scrum" workshop. 

* [Presentation Human Centered Design and Agile](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Presentation%20Human%20Centered%20Design%20and%20Agile.pdf). An 18F presentation introducing Human Centered Design and how it relates to agile software development.

* [Presentation Organizational and Team Structure](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Presentation%20Organizational%20and%20Team%20Structure.pdf). An 18F presentation describing how organizations and teams are structured when working in an agile environment.

## RFP Documents

### Agile Vendor Pool

* [18F Agile Vendor Pool RFQ](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/18F%20Agile%20Vendor%20Pool%20RFQ.docx). This is the RFQ 18F used when creating our Agile Vendor Pool, also referred to as a BPA (Blanket Purchase Agreement).

* [Mississippi Agile Vendor Pool RFP](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Mississippi%20Agile%20Vendor%20Pool%20RFP.docx). This is the RFP Mississippi used when creating their Agile Vendor Pool. Includes a lot of state-specific boilerplate language.

* [Mississippi Agile Vendor Pool RFP Lightweight Version](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Mississippi%20Agile%20Vendor%20Pool%20RFP%20Lightweight%20version.docx). This is a lightweight version of the Mississippi Agile Vendor Pool, before state boilerplate was inserted. 

* [Mississippi Potential RFP questions](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Mississippi%20Potential%20Vendor%20Questions%20for%20Vendor%20Pool%20RFP.xlsx). These were a list of questions Mississippi wanted to ensure were answered in their RFP, gathered largely from vendor questions California and 18F recieved when creating their Agile Vendor Pools.

### Prototype Challenge

* [Mississippi Vendor Challenge](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/Mississippi%20Vendor%20Challenge.docx). When evaluating who should be awarded a spot on their Agile Vendor Pool, Mississippi followed in 18F and California's footsteps by asking vendors to prove their abilities, not just write about them. "Prose" responses to the RFP are limited to a few hundred words, and a majority of the evaluation was based on the quality of a prototype each vendor submitted in response to a challenge.

* [Mississippi Vendor Prototype Evaluation Notes](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/18F%20Vendor%20Prototype%20Evaluation%20Notes.docx). These are some thoughts about what to look for when evaluating a prototype. It is important to have an experienced developer in the given technology perform the evaluations. While this list is a nice guideline, it is not a checklist and it is not exhaustive or complete. A proficient developer should be part of the evaluation panel, and they should be able to judge whether the code is quality or not.

### Vendor Pool Evaluation and Post Award

* [18F Agile BPA Evaluation Factors](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/18F%20Agile%20BPA%20Evaluation%20Factors.docx). These are the evaluation factors that 18F used when evaluating vendors for our Agile Vendor Pool.

* [18F Example Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan for a Contract](https://github.com/18F/bpa-opm-eqip/blob/master/QASP.md). This is 18F's quality assurance surveillance plan for individual task orders to the agile vendor pool.

### Task Orders to the Vendor Pool

* [18F Sample Live Interview Questions](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/18F%20Sample%20Live%20Interview%20Questions.docx). For task orders on 18F's Agile BPA, we bring vendors in for oral interviews. This is a sample of the interview questions 18F used for one round of interviews.

* [California Intake Module Statement of Work](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/California%20Intake%20Module%20Statement%20of%20Work.docx). This is the solicitation California sent to their agile vendor pool for the Intake module of their child welfare system replacement.

* [California Nonfunctional Requirements](https://github.com/18F/Modular-Contracting-And-Agile-Development/raw/master/pages/files/California%20Nonfunctional%20Requirements.docx). These are the non-functional, technical requirements that California included in their solicitations to the agile vendor pool.
