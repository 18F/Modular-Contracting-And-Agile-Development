GSA helps keep the nation safe by providing tools, equipment, and non-tactical vehicles to the U.S. military, and providing state and local governments with law enforcement equipment, firefighting and rescue equipment, and disaster recovery products and services.

Only one percent of GSAâ€™s total budget is provided through direct congressional appropriations. The majority of GSA's operating costs are recovered through the products and services it provides.

GSA leads the way in green building design, construction, retrofit and sustainable operations and maintenance. GSA is building a 21st century government that procures and manages technology solutions in smart, secure, and affordable ways. It supports reductions in federal government real estate costs and increases in workplace efficiencies by strategically integrating space, people, and technology solutions customized to different workplace needs.
