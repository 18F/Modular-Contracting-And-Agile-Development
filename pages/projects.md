# Work

In its first portfolio of work, SBST executed proof-of-concept projects in two categories where behavioral insights could lead to quantifiable and rapid improvements in program outcomes and in the lives of Americans:

1.  Assisting Americans by streamlining access to programs: Projects to streamline access to programs in retirement security, education, health care, and economic opportunity.  

2.  Streamlining government operations: Projects to improve program integrity, promote efficiencies by government workers, and help officials make cost-effective decisions.

In nearly all cases, SBST was able to generate evidence about the effectiveness of these behavioral insights applications using randomized evaluations - the gold standard of evidence among policymakers and social scientists. This report contains a summary of this work.
