18F has committed to working with open source software because developing in the open has real benefits, especially for the public sector. The [18F Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md) explains the benefits of open source and answers many common questions about security, licensing, distribution, and exceptions. Our policy is _itself_ open source, which means it can be adapted for state use.

* For a primer on how to begin to work on open source software projects, our [getting started with 18F Micro-purchase](https://pages.18f.gov/micropurchase/docs/getting-started/) guide has extensive guidance and resources. It was written for potential clients of our micro-purchase platform (which allows federal agencies to purchase small amounts of open source code for integration into an existing software product), but much of the guidance applies to any open source project.
* Our blog entry on [facts about publishing open source code in government](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/08/08/facts-about-publishing-open-source-code-in-government/) dispels some common myths about open source software.

#### Using open source software makes it easier to secure our systems and helps mitigate risks.

It is our belief — generally accepted among a number of security researchers, government officials (including federal CIOs and CTOs) — that well-managed, well-written open source software can be just as secure as closed source software, if not more so.

The [Department of Defense Memo on Open Source Software](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/) has a great explanation of [why hiding source code does not automatically make source code more secure](http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_Doesn.27t_hiding_source_code_automatically_make_software_more_secure.3F).

Open source software allows defenders, researchers, and IT providers to follow best practices and work together to make the software as secure as possible.

#### Open source systems are maintained much like closed source systems, but with more options for community support.

Government open source systems — like closed source systems — are maintained by skilled software developers who ensure that applications, operating systems, middleware, and libraries are up-to-date and secure.

In closed source systems, there are limited choices for continued development and support (often within one or several companies).

We work to ensure that an open source solution can be adopted by a larger group in the open source community, to support its ongoing development with the help of a wider community.

#### When you employ open source software, you are responsible for ensuring it meets your needs — just like closed source software.

Open source software requires quality review and ongoing maintenance, just like closed source software. Without the appropriate expert review, the risk of unknowingly receiving buggy software is the same for both open and closed software.

All software needs to be maintained and updated to continue to function, especially as technology, compliance requirements, and processes change.

As with any government IT solution, closed- or open-source, the burden of ensuring the functionality, security, and operability of the solution ultimately rests with government. Open source software can provide more transparency about the health of government software, and expand options for maintainance. Working in the open can also make vendors more accountable to the software development community because their work is visible.

#### Open source software supports your team’s technical skill development.

If your internal team needs to develop the technical skills to evaluate, customize, and maintain modern software systems, open source solutions can provide opportunities for workforce development by ensuring access to code. This grounds technical training and talent acquisition in the actual products and processes that are used.
