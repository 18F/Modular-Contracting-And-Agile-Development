## What is the issue?

Many individuals would like to save more for retirement.  But the savings part is…hard.  Research shows that individuals intend to save more for retirement than they actually do.  Sixty-eight percent of savers report that their savings rate is too low.  Even among those individuals who express an intention to increase contributions to their 401(k) retirement plan, only 12.5% do so.
The military, like civilian Federal government, offers a workplace savings plan called the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).  Enrollment in the TSP among military Servicemembers average 42 percent.

## What is the insight?

In order to enroll, Servicemembers need to log in to the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) MyPay website and select a contribution percentage. As TSP savings through traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions can confer both short- and long-term benefits, many of the over 800,000 unenrolled Servicemembers might choose to enroll in TSP if actively presented with a chance to do so.

## What was the intervention?

Unenrolled Servicemembers were sent emails that highlighted the opportunity and potential benefits of TSP. Eight different messages utilized different combinations of behavioral insights: clear action steps, fresh-start messaging, presentation of the decision to enroll in TSP as a choice between two options, and emphasis on short- and long-term benefits. Most of the over 800,000 Servicemembers who were not enrolled in TSP as of April 27 received one of the eight emails.

## What was the impact?

The most effective email clarified the action steps needed to enroll and emphasized the potential long-term benefits of saving even a little each month. Sixty-seven percent more Servicemembers—4,930—enrolled in TSP in May 2015 as a result of being sent one of the messages with behavioral insights, compared to receiving no message at all.
