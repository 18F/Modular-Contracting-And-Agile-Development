## What is the issue?

Many farms in the United States, including small and beginning farms, do not have access to the credit that they need to build and sustain their operations.  To fill this need, the Farm Service Agency (USDA) provides credit to qualified borrowers who have been unable to obtain farm credit from commercial lenders.  This extension of credit might be especially helpful for beginning farmers, or farmers who are establishing operations such as urban farms that are not served by the commercial lending industry.  Farms like these often lack the type of business records necessary to qualify for commercial loans, creating a catch-22 situation that makes it difficult to build new businesses.  Microloans are a particular type of loan offered by FSA that helps to fill the needs for businesses like these.

## What is the insight?

In order to provide credit to a broad array of agricultural entrepreneurs, especially those who might be new to farming and who might not participate in other USDA programs, it is critical to disseminate information about the availability of microloans widely.  This information must be succinct and targeted, providing individuals with clear action-steps that they can take to learn more about, or apply for, loans from FSA.

## What was the intervention?

A one-page letter was developed that included detailed information on the availability of microloans.  The letter contained customized contact information for every recipient, directing each farmer to the loan officer in their home county.  A broad sampling of individuals received the letter, expanding access to program information to individuals who had not previously participated in USDA programs or been a customer of FSA.

## What was the impact?

The letter lead to a significant increase in applications (and successful applications) for microloans, as well as an increase in inquiries to county loan officers, exposing a new crop of farmers to an important FSA program.
