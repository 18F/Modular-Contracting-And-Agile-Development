## What is the issue?

Transactions with the government often involve self-reporting.  As part of many government programs, individuals or businesses report things like income, sales figures, use of services, etc. on government forms.  What is reported on these forms impacts how much individuals and businesses owe in taxes, fees, assure compliance with regulations, and can impact eligibility for government benefits.  Truthful and accurate self-reporting is a cost-effective way to collect information that is critical to the operation of major Federal programs.

## What is the insight?

Experiments have shown that requiring a signature at the beginning of forms rather than at the end of forms reduces self-report errors.  Most forms that require signatures, of course, ask for the signature at the bottom of the form.  This means that individuals usually are prompted to provide their signature only after the work on the form is done.  Reversing this process – drawing attention to the request that individuals provide a good-faith report before they begin an exercise – influences what individuals record.

## What was the intervention?

Federal contractors are required to pay a fee, called the industrial funding fee (IFF) that is based on self-reported quarterly sales.  The size of the IFF payment is determined from self-reports submitted via a website (https://72a.gsa.gov/).  In FY 2013, contractors self-reported about $34.8 billion in relevant sales, of which the General Services Administration (GSA) collected approximately $269 million in IFF across roughly 47,000 transactions.

To promote attentive and accurate self-reporting of sales, GSA implemented an electronic signature box at the beginning of its online reporting portal.

## What was the impact?

The median firm increased its reported sales by $445 under the treatment condition.  If the signature box were implemented for all contractors, this would translate to an extra $1.66 million in IFF paid to the government per quarter.
