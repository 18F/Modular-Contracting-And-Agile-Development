## What is the issue?

Because of a change in the military pay system, 139,273 active duty members of the Armed Forces needed to re-enroll in their Roth Thrift Savings Plans (TSP) in January 2015 to avoid having their contributions suspended indefinitely. To re-enroll, Servicemembers needed to log in to the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DOD) MyPay website and select a contribution percentage.

## What is the insight?

These Servicemembers had previously enrolled in Roth TSP accounts, and so DOD and SBST worked together to redesign the email encouraging actions to make the actions as simple and easy to follow as possible. The redesigned outreach email emphasized the New Year as a fresh start, laid out the three steps needed to complete the re-enrollment process, and encouraged action in order to avoid losing the chance to contribute savings.

## What was the intervention?

A new outreach letter was mailed to randomly selected zip codes. It provided information on the benefits of the microloan program, a shortened URL for accessing more information online, and customized contact information directing each farmer to the loan officer in his or her home county.  A broad sampling of farmers received the letter, including individuals who had not previously participated in USDA programs or been a customer of FSA.

## What was the impact?

The letters more than doubled the amount of microloan-related activity in FSA county offices, introducing the microloan program widely to farmers who might benefit.  The letter also influenced the number of successful applicants, increasing the percentage from approximately 0.09 percent to 0.11 percent.
