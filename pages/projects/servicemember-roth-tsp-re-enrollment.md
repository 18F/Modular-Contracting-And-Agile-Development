## What is the issue?

Because of a change in the military pay system, 139,273 active duty members of the Armed Forces needed to re-enroll in their Roth Thrift Savings Plans (TSP) in January 2015 to avoid having their contributions suspended indefinitely. To re-enroll, Servicemembers needed to log in to the Department of Defense’s (DOD) MyPay website and select a contribution percentage.

## What is the insight?

These Servicemembers had previously enrolled in Roth TSP accounts, and so DOD and SBST worked together to redesign the email encouraging actions to make the actions as simple and easy to follow as possible. The redesigned outreach email emphasized the New Year as a fresh start, laid out the three steps needed to complete the re-enrollment process, and encouraged action in order to avoid losing the chance to contribute savings.

## What was the intervention?

The 139,273 Servicemembers who needed to re-enroll were assigned to two groups based on the last two digits of their Social Security Number (SSN), with those with SSNs ending in 0–49 (n = 69,318) sent the standard email, and Servicemembers with SSNs ending in 50–99 (n = 69,955) sent the redesigned email. After sending the emails on January 2, 2015, DFAS tracked re-enrollment requests.

The redesigned email shows how SBST incorporated specific behavioral insights into the adapted message.

## What was the impact?

One week after the emails were sent, 16,291 Servicemembers who were sent the standard email (23.5 percent) had re-enrolled, compared with 20,061 Servicemembers who were sent the redesigned email (28.7 percent). This means that 22 percent more Servicemembers—3,770—re-enrolled in their Roth TSP, or at least accelerated their re-enrollment, as a result of being sent the redesigned email instead of the standard email. Because the redesigned email was more effective at prompting re-enrollment after one week, a modified version of the more effective message was subsequently scaled to the entire population in follow-up messages that encouraged Servicemembers to act before the deadline. Thus, in addition to demonstrating the relative impact of using behavioral messaging to drive action, this project also illustrates the rapid scalability of insights identified as effective via this type of administrative experiment.
