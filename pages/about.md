## About 18F

18F is an office inside the General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Service that helps other federal agencies build, buy, and share efficient and easy-to-use digital services. You can learn more about [what we deliver](https://18f.gsa.gov/what-we-deliver/). We're a team of developers, designers, product managers, strategists, lawyers, and contracting officers.

### 18F's state and local work

18F is beginning to work with state and local governments, and we look forward to spreading our impact to all levels of government. Due to the legal authority weÂ use to engage and work with states, we do not build products for our state partners, but we do assist them with product and acquisition strategy and agile coaching. Learn more here by visiting our [State Frequently Asked Questions](https://pages.18f.gov/state-faq/).
