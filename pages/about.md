## Why We're Here

We believe that government works best when it’s designed with from the perspective of the American people.

Programs and benefits access should be intuitive. Information and choices among program options should be clear. Forms should be simple and easy to complete.

Behavioral science provides us with tools for designing the kind of government Americans deserve.

## Why it Matters

The success of Federal policies and programs rests on how well they are designed from the perspective of the individuals, families, communities and businesses they serve. Where behavioral insights-research findings from behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them—have informed the design of Federal programs, they have significantly improved outcomes.

For example, automatic enrollment and automatic escalation in retirement savings plans, as codified in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, have led to billions of dollars in additional savings by Americans.  Similarly, behavioral economics research has found that enabling families to automatically fill portions of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) with existing tax return data and providing families with form assistance led to a significant increase not just in applications for financial aid, but also in subsequent rates of college enrollment.  The complexity of the FAFSA application was more than just a hassle: in some cases it actually led students to forgo or delay going to college altogether.

As this example illustrates, the costs to Americans of policies that do not incorporate a behavioral perspective go beyond lost time, administrative hassles, and inconvenience. Given such demonstrated potential, a responsive government must reflect our best understanding of human behavior—how people engage with, participate in, and respond to policies and programs.

## Who We are

To ensure we build a government that is responsive to citizens, we began recruiting leading behavioral scientists and innovators from across the country and launched the first-ever Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST) in 2014. SBST redesigns government policies and programs using cutting-edge research insights from the behavioral sciences about how people respond to, use, and engage with programs. The team also rigorously tests the impact of its behavioral recommendations using the gold standard of evidence, randomized control trials. SBST is organized under the National Science and Technology Council and also has a central unit in Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) at the General Services Administration (GSA).
