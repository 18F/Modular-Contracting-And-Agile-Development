## Why we're here

We believe that government works best when it’s designed from the perspective of the American people.

Accessing and using programs should be intuitive. Information and choices among program options should be clear. Forms should be simple and easy to complete.

Behavioral science provides us with tools for designing the kind of government Americans deserve.

## Why the social and behavioral sciences matter for Americans

The Federal government administers a wide array of programs on behalf of the American people: financial aid to assist with college access; social insurance programs and tax incentives to promote retirement security; health insurance programs to ensure access to healthcare and financial protection for families; disclosure requirements to help people obtain safer mortgages; etc.

Americans can best realize the benefits of these programs if they are accessible to the audiences they are designed for, offer clear options, and present information intuitively. When programs are designed without these considerations in mind, Americans can incur costs that go beyond lost time and frustration. Research from behavioral science demonstrates that seemingly small barriers to engagement, such as pages of unstructured information, burdensome applications, or poorly presented choices, can prevent programs from effectively reaching the people they are intended to serve.

Consider financial aid for college as an example. One study found that a complex application process for financial aid actually led students to forego or delay going to college together. Fortunately, behavioral science not only identifies aspects of programs that can act as barriers to engagement, but also provides policymakers with insight into how those barriers can be broken down. That same study showed that simply streamlining the process of applying, by providing families with assistance and enabling them to prepopulate parts of the form using existing tax return data, increased not only application rates, but also college enrollment rates.

When these insights are brought into policy, the returns are significant. College is now more accessible to millions of American families, because the Federal government leveraged insights from the financial aid study and simplified the process of applying for Federal student aid.  Similarly, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which codified the practice of automatically enrolling workers into retirement savings plans, is based on behavioral economics research showing that the switch from an opt-in to an opt-out enrollment system dramatically increases participation and savings rates.  Since the implementation of this policy, automatic enrollment and automatic escalation have led to billions of dollars in additional savings by Americans.

An effective and efficient government must, therefore, reflect our best understanding of human behavior—how people engage with, participate in, and respond to policies and programs. The Social and Behavioral Sciences Team is here to work with agencies to do this.

## Who we are

The Social & Behavioral Sciences Team includes leading behavioral scientists and innovators from across the country. SBST is organized under the National Science and Technology Council, and receives particular support from a unit in the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) at the General Services Administration (GSA).
