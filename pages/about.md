## Why We're Here

We believe that government works best when it’s designed from the perspective of the American people.

Accessing and using programs should be intuitive. Information and choices among program options should be clear. Forms should be simple and easy to complete.

Behavioral science provides us with tools for designing the kind of government Americans deserve.

## Why the Social and Behavioral Sciences Matter for Americans

The Federal government administers a wide array of programs on behalf of the American people: financial aid to assist with college access, social insurance programs and tax incentives to promote retirement security, health insurance programs to ensure access to healthcare and financial protection for families, disclosure requirements to help people obtain safer mortgages, and others.

But Americans can only realize the  benefits of these programs if the programs are easy to access, understand, and use. Research from behavioral science demonstrates that seemingly small barriers to engagement, such as pages of unstructured information, burdensome applications, or poorly presented choices, can prevent programs from effectively reaching the people they are intended to serve. An effective and efficient government must, therefore, reflect our best understanding of human behavior — how people engage with, participate in, and respond to policies and programs.
