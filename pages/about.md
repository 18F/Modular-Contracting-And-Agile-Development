## About 18F

We help federal agencies build, buy, and share modern digital services to improve the user experience of government. Learn more about us at (18f.gsa.gov). We are a team of developers, designers, product managers, strategists, lawyers, and contracting officers.

### 18F's State and Local Work

18F is beginning to work with state and local governments. We believe in the impact state and local governments have on individuals, and we look forward to helping multiply that impact by 50 states.
