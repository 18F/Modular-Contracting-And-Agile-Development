This report was developed by the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team, a cross agency team organized under the National Science and Technology Council. Its publication marks an important milestone for the Administration’s policy of using behavioral science to strengthen the ways in which Federal programs and policies serve the nation — a policy that was codified in September 2015 in xx-xxx.

In its first year, SBST executed proof-of-concept projects in two categories where behavioral insights could lead to quantifiable and rapid improvements in program outcomes and in the lives of Americans:

- **Assisting Americans by streamlining access to programs:** projects to streamline access to programs in retirement security, education, health care, and economic opportunity.

- **Streamlining government operations:** projects to improve program integrity, promote efficiencies by government workers, and help officials make cost-effective decisions.

In nearly all cases, SBST was able to generate evidence about the effectiveness of these behavioral insights applications using randomized evaluations—the gold standard of evidence among policymakers and social scientists. This report contains a summary of this work.
