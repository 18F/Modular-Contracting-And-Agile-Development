# 18F Modular Contracting Website

This repo contains a Jekyll website to showcase and share the 18F Acquisition Team's work on modular contracting. This content is divided into three main sections:

* Strategies: a brief overview of the strategies used by the Acquisition Team on modular contracting engagements.
* Examples: featured projects that showcase some of the work we have done with partners.
* Assets: Materials that we have developed through the course of our work that we want to share with those interested in learning more about modular contracting.
