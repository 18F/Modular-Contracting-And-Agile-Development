# Modern Team Template for Federalist

This is a Jekyll site. It is a simple site to showcase the work of an organization with a few different page types.

This particular site is made for use with the [Federalist](https://github.com/18f/federalist) in mind.

This template uses the CSS and JavaScript from [U.S. Web Design System](https://standards.18f.gov). To update the version of the system, [download the code](https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/download/) from the website. Unzip the download and drop the entire folder (which should be named something like `uswds-1.1.0`) into `assets/vendor`.

In your `_config.yml`, update the `wds-version` value to the new version number. This should match the version number in the name of the folder you just downloaded. In the case of our example, it would look like this: `wds-version: 1.1.0`. You'll need to restart your Jekyll server to see the new code take effect.
