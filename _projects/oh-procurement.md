## The Challenge

Like other states, the technology procurement process in Ohio tends to attract a small number of large, incumbent vendors that bid on state IT project. The procurement process is often viewed as burdensome and costly, and there can be few incentives for new or smaller firms to bid on state work. This can make it more challenging to receive competitive bids, and limits the state's flexibility in identify industry partners that can provide the best service for the citizens of Ohio.

## How We're Helping

We worked directly with State CIO Stu Davis to identify ways that the State of Ohio could modify it's existing process to attract smaller, more nimble vendors to bid on state IT projects. Those proposed changes have since been incorporated into newly adopted changes to the Ohio procurement rules, opening the door for more and more vendors to bid on state work.
