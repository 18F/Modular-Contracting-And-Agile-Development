## The Challenge

In 2015, the State of California began a process to modernize their child welfare services case management system. This system is used by more than 20,000 social workers to track and manage the more than 500,000 cases of child abuse and neglect that are reported in California each year. Every year, 30,000 children are removed from their homes, which means the stakes are too high for this system to be using outdated technology to investigate and manage California’s most vulnerable youth population who may be victims of abuse. And, although the state of California runs the system, the federal government pays for 50 percent of its cost through a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services.

## How We're Helping

Since late 2015, 18F has worked with California’s Department of Social Services and Office of Systems Integration to implement [modular contracting](/modular-procurement/), [agile development](/agile-development/), user-centered design, and [open source](/open-source/) practices into their modernization project. This project is still in the early stages, but this change in strategy has started to produce greater vendor competition, cost savings, a vastly improved end product, and a better contracting experience for California’s Department of Social Services. All of this is being done to focus the valuable time of Child Welfare Professionals in California on helping the deeply vulnerable population of children who are the victims of abuse and neglect.
